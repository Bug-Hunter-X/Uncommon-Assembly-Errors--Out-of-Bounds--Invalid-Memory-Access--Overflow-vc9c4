To mitigate these issues, robust checks should be implemented before executing potentially unsafe operations. 
;Improved code with bounds checking and error handling:
mov ecx, [some_ecx_value]; get the value of ecx from somewhere
mov eax, ecx ;assume that ecx is a valid index
cmp ecx, array_size ;check if ecx is larger than array_size
jge handle_error ;if ecx is >= than array_size, then jump to handle_error
mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ;only execute this line if ecx is smaller than array_size
mov edx, [eax] ;accessing memory only if the index is valid
jmp next_instruction;jump to next instruction
handle_error:
; Handle the error appropriately, such as displaying an error message or taking corrective action
next_instruction:
add eax, 10h ;add 10h only if the previous instructions have been executed correctly
;add additional checks to prevent integer overflow.
